<div align="center">

**REVERSIBLE TRANSACTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WEB3**

*Built in 2 weeks. Production-ready. Seeking strategic investment.*

</div>

---

## Executive Summary

REVERSO is the first **non-custodial reversible transaction protocol** for EVM chains. We solve a $3.8B annual problem: crypto transactions are irreversible, causing massive losses from mistakes, phishing, and fraud.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Problem Size** | $3.8B+ lost annually |
| **Solution** | Time-locked reversible transfers |
| **Product Status** | MVP complete, 66/66 tests passing |
| **Chains Supported** | 5 live (ETH, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon) |
| **Revenue Model** | 0.3-0.7% fees + 0.2% insurance + API subscriptions |
| **Ask** | $50,000 |
| **Use** | Security audit + enterprise partnerships + go-to-market |

---

## The Problem

Every blockchain transaction is **final and irreversible**. This creates massive friction:

| Problem | Annual Loss | Who Suffers |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 🎣 Phishing & Scams | $3.8B | Retail users |
| 📝 Wrong Address | $1.2B | Everyone |
| 💀 Smart Contract Bugs | $1.5B | DeFi users |
| 🏢 Payroll Errors | $500M+ | Enterprises |
| **TOTAL** | **$7B+** | **The entire ecosystem** |

**For enterprises, this is unacceptable risk:**
- Exchanges face chargebacks they can't reverse
- Payroll providers risk sending to wrong addresses
- E-commerce loses customers afraid of crypto payments
- DAO treasuries have no safety net

---

## The Solution

REVERSO introduces a **non-custodial safety layer** between sender and recipient:

│   If all fails → rescue after 90 days                          │
│                                                                 │
│   🛡️ 5 LAYERS OF PROTECTION:                                   │

│   3. Recovery Address 2 (exchange backup)                       │
│   4. Auto-refund after expiry                                   │
│   5. Rescue abandoned funds (90 days)                           │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Non-custodial**: Funds stay in smart contract, not our wallets
- **Configurable lock**: 1 hour to 30 days
- **Multi-chain**: Same UX across 5+ EVM chains
- **Insurance option**: +0.2% for full scam protection
- **Enterprise API**: HMAC-secured, rate-limited, webhook-enabled

### 🔌 Enterprise API - Use Cases

#### 1. **CRYPTO PAYROLL** - HR & Fintech
```
POST /api/v1/usecases/payroll
```
**Problem:** Companies paying salaries in crypto risk sending to wrong addresses.  
**Solution:** Batch payroll with 72h lock. HR can cancel individual payments if errors detected.

```json
{
  "chainId": 42161,
  "payroll": [

## Revenue Model

| Stream | Rate | Projected Revenue* |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Transaction Fees** | 0.3-0.7% (progressive) | $5.8M/year @ $1B volume |
| **Insurance Premiums** | 0.2% on premium transfers | $600K/year |
| **API Subscriptions** | $99-$2,000/month | $600K/year |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$7M/year** |

*Projections based on capturing 0.1% of annual DeFi transaction volume

### Progressive Fee Structure
| Amount | Fee | Example |
|--------|-----|---------|
| < $1,000 | 0.3% | $500 → $1.50 fee |
| $1K - $100K | 0.5% | $10,000 → $50 fee |
| > $100,000 | 0.7% | $1M → $7,000 fee |

**Why progressive?** Small users pay less (adoption), whales pay more (premium service).
